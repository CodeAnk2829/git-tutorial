Currently we are learning branching basics in git
We are at test branch now
After merge conflict we are trying to merge test branch into master branch


branch 'develop' starts
commit c1
commit c2
commiting from test branch
commit c3
commit c4
again commiting from test branch
branch 'topic' starts
commit c1 not from topic branch but from the test branch
